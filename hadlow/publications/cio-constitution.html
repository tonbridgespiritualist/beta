	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Name</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>The name of the Charitable Incorporated Organisation (&ldquo;the CIO&rdquo;) is Tonbridge Spiritualist Centre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="2">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> National location of principal office</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>The principal office of the CIO is in England.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="3">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Objects</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>The objects of the CIO are:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To advance the Spiritualist religion</li>
	<li>To promote the truths and beliefs of Spiritualism</li>
	<li>To heal the sick and suffering by thought, word and deed</li>
</ol>
<p>Nothing in this Constitution shall authorise an application of the property of the CIO for the purposes which are not charitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="4">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Powers</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>The CIO has power to do anything which is calculated to further its objects or is conducive or incidental to doing so. In particular, the CIO has power to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of its property as security for the repayment of the money borrowed. The CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 124 and 125 of the Charities Act 2011, if it wishes to mortgage land;</li>
	<li>buy, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire any property and to maintain and equip it for use;</li>
	<li>sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the property belonging to the CIO. In exercising this power, the CIO must comply as appropriate with sections 117 and 119-123 of the Charities Act 2011;</li>
	<li>employ and remunerate such staff as are necessary for carrying out the work of the CIO.</li>
</ol>
<p>The CIO may employ or remunerate a charity trustee only to the extent that it is permitted to do so by clause 6 (Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons) and provided it complies with the conditions of that clause;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="5">
	<li>deposit or invest funds, employ a professional fund-manager, and arrange for the investments or other property of the CIO to be held in the name of a nominee, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do by the Trustee Act 2000.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="5">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Application of income and property</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The income and property of the CIO must be applied solely towards the promotion of the objects.</p>
<p>(a) A charity trustee is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of the CIO or may pay out of such property reasonable expenses properly incurred by him or her when acting on behalf of the CIO.</p>
<p>(b) A charity trustee may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance cover purchased at the CIO&rsquo;s expense in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, section 189 of the Charities Act 2011.</p>
<p>(2) None of the income or property of the CIO may be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend, bonus or otherwise by way of profit to any member of the CIO.</p>
<p>(3) Nothing in this clause shall prevent a charity trustee or connected person receiving any benefit or payment which is authorised by Clause 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="6">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Benefits and payments to charity trustees and connected persons</h2></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">1. General provisions</h3>
<p>No charity trustee or connected person may:</p>
<ul class="tsc-list">
	<li>a) buy or receive any goods or services from the CIO on terms preferential to those applicable to members of the public;</li>
	<li>b) sell goods, services, or any interest in land to the CIO;</li>
	<li>	<li>c) be employed by, or receive any remuneration from, the CIO;</li>
	<li>d) receive any other financial benefit from the CIO;</li>
</ul>
<p>unless the payment or benefit is permitted by sub-clause 2 of this clause or authorised by the court or the Charity Commission (&ldquo;the Commission&rdquo;). In this clause, a &ldquo;financial benefit&rdquo; means a benefit, direct or indirect, which is either money or has a monetary value.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">2. Scope and powers permitting trustees&rsquo; or connected persons&rsquo; benefits</h3>
<p>(a) A charity trustee or connected person may receive a benefit from the CIO as a beneficiary of the CIO provided that a majority of the trustees do not benefit in this way.</p>
<p>(b) A charity trustee or connected person may enter into a contract for the supply of services, or of goods that are supplied in connection with the provision of services, to the CIO where that is permitted in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in, sections 185 to 188 of the Charities Act 2011.</p>
<p>(c) Subject to sub-clause (3) of this clause a charity trustee or connected person may provide the CIO with goods that are not supplied in connection with services provided to the CIO by the charity trustee or connected person.</p>
<p>(d) A charity trustee or connected person may receive interest on money lent to the CIO at a reasonable and proper rate which must be not more than the Bank of England bank rate (also known as the base rate).</p>
<p>(e) A charity trustee or connected person may receive rent for premises let by the trustee or connected person to the CIO. The amount of the rent and the other terms of the lease must be reasonable and proper. The charity trustee concerned must withdraw from any meeting at which such a proposal or the rent or other terms of the lease are under discussion.</p>
<p>(f) A charity trustee or connected person may take part in the normal trading and fundraising activities of the CIO on the same terms as members of the public.</p>
<p>(3) Payment for supply of goods only &ndash; controls</p>
<p>The CIO and its charity trustees may only rely upon the authority provided by sub-clause (2)(c) of this clause if each of the following conditions is satisfied:</p>
<p>(a) The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods is set out in a written agreement between the CIO and the charity trustee or connected person supplying the goods (&ldquo;the supplier&rdquo;).</p>
<p>(b) The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods does not exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances for the supply of the goods in question.</p>
<p>(c) The other charity trustees are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the CIO to contract with the supplier rather than with someone who is not a charity trustee or connected person. In reaching that decision the charity trustees must balance the advantage of contracting with a charity trustee or connected person against the disadvantages of doing so.</p>
<p>(d) The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at which there is discussion of the proposal to enter into a contract or arrangement with him or her or it with regard to the supply of goods to the CIO.</p>
<p>(e) The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not to be counted when calculating whether a quorum of charity trustees is present at the meeting.</p>
<p>(f) The reason for their decision is recorded by the charity trustees in the minute book.</p>
<p>(g) A majority of the charity trustees then in office are not in receipt of remuneration or payments authorised by clause 6.</p>
<p>(4) In sub-clauses (2) and (3) of this clause:</p>
<p>(a) &ldquo;the CIO&rdquo; includes any company in which the CIO:</p>
<p>(i) holds more than 50% of the shares; or</p>
<p>(ii) controls more than 50% of the voting rights attached to the shares; or</p>
<p>(iii) has the right to appoint one or more directors to the board of the company;</p>
<p>(b) &ldquo;connected person&rdquo; includes any person within the definition set out in clause 29 (Interpretation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="7">
	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Conflicts of interest and conflicts of loyalty</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>A charity trustee must:</p>
<p>(1) declare the nature and extent of any interest, direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the CIO or in any transaction or arrangement entered into by the CIO which has not previously been declared; and</p>
<p>(2) absent himself or herself from any discussions of the charity trustees in which it is possible that a conflict of interest will arise between his or her duty to act solely in the interests of the CIO and any personal interest (including but not limited to any financial interest).</p>
<p>Any charity trustee absenting himself or herself from any discussions in accordance with this clause must not vote or be counted as part of the quorum in any decision of the charity trustees on the matter.</p>

<p>reasonable in the circumstances having regard in particular to:</p>
<p>(i) any special knowledge or experience that he or she has or holds himself or herself out as having; and,</p>

	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> Delegation by charity trustees</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>(1) The charity trustees may delegate any of their powers or functions to a committee or committees, and, if they do, they shall determine the terms and conditions on which the delegation is made. The charity trustees may at any time alter those terms and conditions or revoke the delegation.</p>
<p>(2) This power is in addition to the power of delegation in the General Regulations and any other power of delegation available to the charity trustees, but is subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p>(a) a committee may consist of two or more persons, but at least one member of each committee must be a charity trustee;</p>
<p>(b) the acts and proceedings of any committee must be brought to the attention of the charity trustees as a whole as soon as is reasonably practicable; and</p>

<p>(a) Any charity trustee may call a meeting of the charity trustees (or Executive Committee as provisioned in clause 14(3)).</p>
<p>(b) Subject to that, the charity trustees shall decide how their meetings are to be called, and what notice is required.</p>
<p>(2) Chairing of meetings</p>
<p>The charity trustees may appoint one of their number to chair their meetings and may at any time revoke such appointment. If no-one has been so appointed, or if the person appointed is unwilling to preside or is not present within 10 minutes after the time of the meeting, the charity trustees present may appoint one of their number to chair that meeting.</p>
<p>(3) Procedure at meetings</p>
<p>(a) No decision shall be taken at a meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the decision is taken. The quorum is one charity trustees, or the number nearest to one third of the total number of charity trustees, whichever is greater, or such larger number as the charity trustees may decide from time to time. A charity trustee shall not be counted in the quorum present when any decision is made about a matter upon which he or she is not entitled to vote.</p>
<p>(b) Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of those eligible to vote.</p>

<p>be a member of the CIO.</p>
<ol class="tsc-list tsc-list--number" start="17">

<p>(1) Any decision to:</p>
<p>(a) amend the constitution of the CIO;</p>
<p>(b) amalgamate the CIO with, or transfer its undertaking to, one or more other CIOs, in accordance with the Charities Act 2011; or</p>
<p>(c) wind up or dissolve the CIO (including transferring its business to any other charity) must be made by a resolution of the members of the CIO (rather than a resolution of the charity trustees).</p>
<p>(2) Decisions of the members may be made either:</p>
<p>(a) by resolution at a general meeting; or</p>
<p>(b) by resolution in writing, in accordance with sub-clause (4) of this clause.</p>
<p>(3) Any decision specified in sub-clause (1) of this clause must be made in accordance with the provisions of clause 27 (amendment of constitution), clause 28 (Voluntary winding up or dissolution), or the provisions of the Charities Act 2011, the General Regulations or the Dissolution Regulations as applicable. Those provisions require the resolution to be agreed by a 75% majority of those members voting at a general meeting, or agreed by all members in writing.</p>
<p>(4) Except where a resolution in writing must be agreed by all the members, such a resolution may be agreed by a simple majority of all the members who are entitled to vote on it. Such a resolution shall be effective provided that:</p>
<p>(a) a copy of the proposed resolution has been sent to all the members eligible to vote; and</p>
<p>(b) the required majority of members has signified its agreement to the resolution in a document or documents which are received at the principal office within the period of 28 days beginning with the circulation date. The document signifying a member&rsquo;s agreement must be authenticated by their signature, by a statement of their identity accompanying the document, or in such other manner as the CIO has specified.</p>
<p>The resolution in writing may comprise several copies to which one or more members has signified their agreement. Eligibility to vote on the resolution is limited to members who are members of the CIO on the date when the proposal is first circulated.</p>

	<li><h2 class="tsc-heading-l"> General meetings of members</h2></li>
</ol>
<p>(1) Calling of general meetings of members</p>
<p>The charity trustees may designate any of their meetings as a general meeting of the members of the CIO. The purpose of such a meeting is to discharge any business which must by law be discharged by a resolution of the members of the CIO as specified in clause 17 (Decisions which must be made by the members of the CIO).</p>
<p>(2) Notice of general meetings of members</p>
<p>(a) The minimum period of notice required to hold a general meeting of the members of the CIO is 14 days.</p>
<p>(b) Except where a specified period of notice is strictly required by another clause in this constitution, by the Charities Act 2011 or by the General Regulations, a general meeting may be called by shorter notice if it is so agreed by a majority of the members of the CIO.</p>
<p>(c) Proof that an envelope containing a notice was properly addressed, prepaid and posted; or that an electronic form of notice was properly addressed and sent, shall be conclusive evidence that the notice was given. Notice shall be deemed to be given 48 hours after it was posted or sent.</p>
<p>(3) Procedure at general meetings of members</p>
<p>The provisions in clause 15 (2)-(4) governing the chairing of meetings, procedure at meetings and participation in meetings by electronic means apply to any general meeting of the members, with all references to trustees to be taken as references to members.</p>

	<li>who was disqualified from holding office;</li>
	<li>who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the constitution to vacate office;</li>

</ul>
<p>(2) Sub-clause (1) of this clause does not permit a charity trustee to keep any benefit that may be conferred upon him or her by a resolution of the charity trustees or of a committee of charity trustees if, but for sub-clause (1), the resolution would have been void, or if the charity trustee has not complied with clause 7 (Conflicts of interest).</p>
